🧑🏾‍💻 I'm currently an undergraduate CS + AI Student at UOL and aspiring Researcher/SWE.

🔬 My research interests are in ML/DL, Quant, Space Technology & Robotics 

🧑🏾‍🎓 When I graduate, I would like to pursure a pathway either as a Researcher, Software Engineer, Quant, Developer, Programmer...

📚 I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Computer Science And Academia.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏾‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently, I am working as a part-time **Software Avionics Engineer** at LASER (Liverpool Association for Space Engineering research) currently working mainly on *LIFTS (LASER's Integrated Flight Tracking System) on the Electronics/Programming Subsystems Team as part of LASER's PULSAR (Propulsion Unit for LASER's Spacecraft and Aerospace Research) Unity Rise Rocket Team 24/25.* 

## 🔬 Research
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented a Simple MNIST Digit Classifier Neural Network made from scratch* in Python with only core libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and tqdm. The purpose was to *implement a feed-foward neural network model/MLP (multilayer perceptron) that can recognise and classify numerical handwritten digits from the MNIST data as well as gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying core mathematics and algorithms such as forward propagation, backpropagation, ReLu (Rectified Linear unit) activation function, Softmax activation function...*

To accompany this work, I have a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/tree/main) that contains the [Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/blob/main/SimpleMNISTDigitClassifier.ipynb) with accompanying code and results as well the corresponding [Research Paper](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/blob/main/Research%20Paper/SimpleMNISTDigitClassifierNeuralNetworkPaper.pdf), communicating the Paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to have a read through the [Research Paper and the accompanying Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/tree/main).
