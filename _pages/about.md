👨🏾‍💻 I'm currently an **undergraduate CS + AI Student** and aspiring Researcher/SWE.

🔬 My research interests are in ML/DL, Quant, Space Technology & Robotics 

👨🏾‍🎓 When I graduate, I would like to pursure a pathway either as a Researcher, Software Engineer, Quant, Developer, Programmer...

📚 I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence And Academia.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏾‍🔬 Professional Experience
Kalvin is an **undergraduate Computer Science with Aritificial Intelligence student** attending **UoL**. Kalvin works as a **Software Engineer at LASER**, a student-led **research group focused on research in Space-based Engineering**, supported by the Electronics and Electrical Engineering department at UoL. His latest efforts include working as a **part-time Software Avionics Engineer** at LASER (Liverpool Association for Space Engineering research) currently working mainly on *LIFTS (LASER's Integrated Flight Tracking System) on the Electronics/Programming Subsystems Team as part of LASER's PULSAR (Propulsion Unit for LASER's Spacecraft and Aerospace Research) Unity Rise Rocket Team 24/25.* 


## 🔬 Research
Kalvin has experience with independent research. Recently, he has implemented a **Simple MNIST Digit Classifier Neural Network made from scratch*** in Python with only core libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and tqdm. The purpose was to *implement a feed-foward neural network model/MLP (multilayer perceptron) that can recognise and classify numerical handwritten digits from the MNIST data as well as gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying core mathematics and algorithms such as forward propagation, backpropagation, ReLu (Rectified Linear unit) activation function, Softmax activation function...* Kalvin also has a **blog** where he **publishes** his **research findings, summarises research papers, shares insights and tutorials** on various topics related to **Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence.**

To accompany this work, there is a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/tree/main) that contains the [Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/blob/main/SimpleMNISTDigitClassifier.ipynb) with accompanying code and results as well the corresponding [Research Paper](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/blob/main/Research%20Paper/SimpleMNISTDigitClassifierNeuralNetworkPaper.pdf), communicating the Paper's theory and results.

Feel free to have a read through the [Research Paper and the accompanying Juypter Notebook](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Simple-MNIST-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Network/tree/main).
