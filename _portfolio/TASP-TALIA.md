In this project, I implemented [TASP-TALIA](https://github.com/T-Kalv/Tasp-Talia-). TASP (Totally Auto Stock Pinger) is a stock price notifier that notifies the user when their desired stocks need to be sold and bought. TALIA (Totally Artifical Language Intelligence Assistant) is an AI virtual assistant that assists to the user with their day to day life.

## Features:
- Frontend:
    - Uses a Python CLI/Voice Interface that display information to the user via the terminal
    - Handles user interaction via types commands using the chat interface or voice commands using the voice interface
    - Displays live outputs such as stock portfolio information, weather, news, headlines, calendars, Wikipedia, unit conversions...

- Backend:
    - Uses Python as the backend with multiple libraries for certain features...
    - Uses `neuralintents.GenericAssistant` to load the pre-trained model from `intens.json` so TALIA can use the trained model that was previously learnt to map the types/spoken queries from the user commands to their respective functions
    - Fetched live stock price data using Yahoo Finance
    - Integrates with external API/Services for information such as Weather, News, Search, Smart Control...
